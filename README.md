# Flipping Masterminds Plugin

The **Flipping Masterminds Plugin** is developed and maintained by the Admins and Owners of the **Flipping Masterminds Discord community**.  
It provides data-driven insights into the **Old School RuneScape (OSRS)** market to help users make informed flipping and merching decisions.

---

## Purpose

This plugin allows users to analyze item performance over time, helping to identify profitable trading opportunities and trends in the OSRS Grand Exchange.

---

## Features

- **Top Performers** — View the highest-performing items over customizable time periods, with optional filters for item value ranges.  
- **Under Performers** — Identify weaker items using similar time-based and value-based filters.  
- **Grand Exchange (GE) Monitoring** — Track GE slot data for use in Discord alerts or analytics, even when not in-game.  
  > *Note: A valid API token is required to send GE data.*
